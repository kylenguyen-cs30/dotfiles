/// Request for semantic information about the symbol at a given location **(LSP Extension)**.
///
/// This request looks up the symbol (if any) at a given text document location and returns
/// SymbolDetails for that location, including information such as the symbol's USR. The symbolInfo
/// request is not primarily designed for editors, but instead as an implementation detail of how
/// one LSP implementation (e.g. SourceKit) gets information from another (e.g. clangd) to use in
/// performing index queries or otherwise implementing the higher level requests such as definition.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - textDocument: The document in which to lookup the symbol location.
///   - position: The document location at which to lookup symbol information.
///
/// - Returns: `[SymbolDetails]` for the given location, which may have multiple elements if there are
///   multiple references, or no elements if there is no symbol at the given location.
///
/// ### LSP Extension
///
/// This request is an extension to LSP supported by SourceKit-LSP and clangd. It does *not* require
/// any additional client or server capabilities to use.

  /// The USR of the called function in `value.doThing` is `A.doThing` (or its
  /// mangled form) but it can never call `D.doThing`. In this case, the

  /// `B` may be called dynamically.
