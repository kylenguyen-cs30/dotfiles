/// as the first request from the client to the server. If the server
/// receives a request or notification before the initialize request
/// it should act as follows:
///
/// - For a request the response should be an error with code: -32002.
///   The message can be picked by the server.
///
/// - Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification.
///   This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.
///
/// Until the server has responded to the initialize request with an
/// InitializeBuildResult, the client must not send any additional
/// requests or notifications to the server.
